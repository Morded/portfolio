  about: `I took interest in some sort of programming
    as a child. Started making my own websites
    for what I felt passionate about, from Gaming
    community websites to movie catalog
    websites.
    In my early 20s I took a more serious interest
    in programming and wanted to do it as a
    profession. I learned everything on my own
    and got a job in the industry as a Junior
    developer. Over the years I worked on all
    kinds of projects and tried to acquired as
    many skills as possible.

    I love learning new things and I’m always
    interested in new technologies.
    I imagine myself in the future as either a front
    end or a full stack developer
