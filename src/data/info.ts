  about: [
    `As a child, I was already interested in programming and design. I created a website for almost anything that I liked to do at the time.
    I Built a website for my Counter Strike 1.6 server, a(n il)legal movie watching site ... and the list goes on.
    I taught myself how to code and I enjoy every aspect of it, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
    I am very passionate about learning new things and experimenting new technologies.
